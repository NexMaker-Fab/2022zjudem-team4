<h1 style="font-size:5vw; text-align:center" >Key Tech Analysis</h1>


<p class="p1" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" > While there are several methods for monitoring water conditions, water quality monitors sample the chemical state of water and measure elements such as salinity, acidity, nutrients, metals, and pollutants. Temperature, sedimentation, and the potential for erosion of stream banks and coastlines may all be monitored. </p>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;">The Importance of Water Monitoring</h4>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
Water monitoring is crucial for gathering the data needed to make smart choices about water quality management in the present and future. The relevance of water monitoring is to comply with Chinese and African regulations, to guarantee health standards, and to safeguard other beneficial uses of water.</p>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
Water availability and quality are under increasing strain as a result of climate change and population increase. Water is a limited resource that must not be squandered, as diminishing water quality has become a reality over the years.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;">
 The Benefits of a Smart Water Quality Monitoring System
 </h4>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
Smart water quality monitoring systems can be used for five main purposes: </p>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
Determine variations or trends in water quality over time.
Analyze and detect current or potential water quality issues
Collect and report data in order to develop preventative or repair strategies.
Assess whether or not response objectives are being reached.
Attend to emergencies </p>

About Water Quality Monitor Systems
 </h4>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
Traditionally, water quality measurement instruments use one or more parameters, including:</p>

- Electrical Conductivity <br>
- Dissolved Oxygen<br>
- Total Dissolved Solids<br>
- Water Temperature<br>
- pH<br>

<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
A more complicated, in-depth examination of water quality can be obtained by combining various water quality sensors.
Manual water sampling may be expensive and time-consuming. Numerous site visits over lengthy periods of time are necessary to get insight from data collecting. This means that it might take years of data collecting before relevant findings are obtained.
Alternative sensor systems might be expensive and have limited data interpretation capabilities. This means that the data might be tough to comprehend; you'd have to be a scientist to grasp anything. RiverWatch interprets it for you.</p>

The Water Quality Solution
 </h4>
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" >
As previously stated, standard water quality measurement methods, such as water sampling and other sensor systems, can be costly, time-consuming, or just unclear. Moreover, delays might lead to erroneous findings, and data interpretation can lead to confusion about what the data truly indicates.</p>

OUR SYSTEM

Our system provides an easier and smarter way to gather water data.

- Turbidity  <br>
- Water Level <br>

<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" ><b> pH sensor</b>: The The pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale with a range of 0-14 and a neutral point of 7. Numbers more than 7 suggest a basic or alkaline solution, whereas values less than 7 indicate an acidic solution. It runs on a 5V power source and is simple to connect to an Arduino. The usual pH range is 6 to 8.5.</p>

<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" ><b>Temperature sensor</b>: Water temperature shows how hot or cold the water is. The temperature sensor DS18B20 has a temperature range of -55 to +125 °C. This temperature sensor is digital and provides precise readings. </p>
<img align="center" src="img\tem1.jpg" alt="box" width="100%" class="center">
<p class="p2" style="font-size :1.1rem; text-align:Justify" ><b>Turbidity sensor</b>: Turbidity is a measure of how cloudy water is. Turbidity has revealed how much clarity the water has lost. It is regarded as an accurate indicator of water quality. Turbidity reduces the amount of light available to submerged aquatic plants. It can also cause surface water temperatures to rise beyond normal because suspended particles near the surface aid in the absorption of heat from the sun. </p>
