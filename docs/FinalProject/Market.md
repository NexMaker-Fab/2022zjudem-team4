<h1 style="font-size:5vw; text-align:center" >Market Analysis</h1>
<p class="p1" style="  font-size :1.1rem; text-align:justify"> Water is one of the necessities for the human life, but unfortunately water pollution is one of the largest challenges for global sustainability. Collecting samples from water sources then testing it in laboratories with some chemical reactants is one of the traditional and tiresome techniques of water quality monitoring. Nowadays sensors are used for water quality monitoring because they are quick and accurate. </p>
<br>

<p class="p1" style="  font-size :1.1rem; text-align:justify">
Water Quality Monitor can give significant information to the engineers, operators, and researchers whose are in charge to get the water quality, it will indicate that the water is good for drinking, irrigation, washing, or any other purpose. There are numerous characteristics those indicate water quality in different ways. If there is change in the water characteristics the sensor will detect these changes. Tracking water quality parameters like PH, turbidity, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen is important for maintaining the quality.
