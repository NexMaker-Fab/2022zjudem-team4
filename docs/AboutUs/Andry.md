<h4 style="text-align:center;">Topic

<p style="color:LightBlue;">About making life easier for travelers, especially backpackers</p>
</h4>

<h4>Solve which problem for your customer</h4>

<p style font-size:110%;>
The hassle of arriving at the checking counter to be told that the weight exceeds the airline's requirements. Many backpackers stay in hostels, because they are on budget, and oftentimes those hostels do not have a balance for weighting suitcases or backpacks, but just a <b><em>regular weighting scale</em></b> and thus, oftentimes backpackers on the cannot get an measure of the weight for their luggage until checking at the counter of the airport.
</p>

<h4>Innovation</h4>

<h4>Market (similar product, price, market channel</h4>

<p style="font-size:100%;">On the market, there are some <b><em>hand balances</em></b> for weighting luggages, but as shown by our questionnaire/statistical analysis most of the travelers do not bother to bring one with them as it adds unnecessary weight to their already very limited *<sub>weight allowance per pax</sub>. Also, as shown by* there are always short of batteries for their devices, etc...*</p>


<h4>Key tech analysis and potential tech problem</h4>
