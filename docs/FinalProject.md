<h4>The project is first designed in Fusion 360, then sent to a Flashforge 3D printer (Guider II series) where it is printed using PLA -that is the material-. Some metal parts will need to be 3D printed.<br>The motor, battery, Arduino Uno and different components used for the project are provided in the Arduino Beginners's Kit.
However, our project will need to use an Arduino Nano IOT, as the one in the kit is way too large and neither features bluetooth or an internet connection.The battery also is way too large and the final project will require a smaller battery.</h4> 

<h4 style="text-align:justify;">
With the use of mathematical logics and basic laws of physics (balancing of forces) the old traditional padlocks have been replaced by new and modified number combination lock.<br>
Padlocks are the portable locks that were designed to defend against any theft, vandalism or sabotage but with passage of time they became part of day to day life as a safety measure. Padlocks used earlier were heavy and required key to unlock but with the number combination lock it became easy to handle the system as the only thing that is required is a code which can activate or deactivate the lock. The second generation of locks, number combination lock, is like a mystery game of combinations and sequences. All one has to do is set their code and activate the lock. <br>
The problem with this sytem is that the user needs to remember the number combination that unlocks the system. Also, sometimes it can get stuck.<br>
Our system provides more convenience and a gain of time, leaving the user totally stress free.<br>
Intead of using a key to unlock the padlock or a number combination lock, our system uses a digital fingerprint reader embedded in the lock that allows to unlock it instantaneously. What else? Only a few users' fingerprint will be recognized. The status, whether it is locked/unlocked is displayed on a screen. Of course the fingerprints in the database to be authorized depend entirely on the owner of the bag featuring the smartlocker.<br>
Apart from this exceptional feature, an integrated scale, along with a tracker and will be also integrated in the backpack. What is more? Our backpack will feature an Arduino Nano IOT that will allow a connection via bluetooth and wifi that will allow it to use a  myriad of applications related to satellite positionning.<br>
In the luxury version, an Emergency Locator Transmitter is also thought to be added,allowing search and rescue to quickly find you should you be in a perilous situation.<br>
All of those features  make our backpack a "must have backpack" in the industry of travel, for adventurers backpackers or business travelers who like to travel light,with only a cabin hand luggage.
 After all is said, for straters, Welcome to the third generation of lock: the <u>D-F Smart Locker.</u>
